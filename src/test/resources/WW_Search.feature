  Scenario: Verify WestwingNow search and wishlist functionality working
    Given I am on the WestwingNow home page "https://www.westwingnow.de"
    When I search for "moÌˆbel"
    Then I should see product listing page with a list of products
    When I click on wishlist icon of the first found product
    Then I should see the login/registration overlay
    When I switch to login form of the overlay
    And I log in with " your_test_account_data (see the note below)"  credentials
    Then the product should be added to the wishlist (wishlist icon on the product is filled in and wishlist counter in the website header shows 1,  screenshot )
  #  And I go to the wishlist page "https://www.westwingnow.de/customer/wishlist/index/"
    And I delete the product from my wishlist
